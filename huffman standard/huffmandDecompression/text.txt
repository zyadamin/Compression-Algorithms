Same steps and concept as Huffman Coding
Algorithm
In order to Minimize Huffman Table size and Codes
lengths, set Minimum Limit of Symbol
Probabilities (e.g. 0.05)
Symbols with Probabilities <= the Limit will be
grouped in one group called “Others”
All Symbols will be coded using Corresponding
Huffman codes, Symbols in “Other” group will be
coded using both “Others” Huffman code
Original Symbol Code.
